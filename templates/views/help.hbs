                <li>When you first visit Weather Assistant, your browser will ask you whether you'd like to allow us to
                    use your current location to get weather information.</li>
                <li>If you click "Allow", Weather Assistant will fetch and display the current weather information for
                    your location.</li>
                <li>If you click "Block", Weather Assistant will use your IP to display the current weather for your
                    location based on your IP address. This would depend on where your ISP is located and will vary if
                    you're using a VPN.</li>
                <li>To get the weather information for a different location, just type an address into the text input
                    field labelled "Enter address/location" and click on the "Get Weather" button.</li>
                <li>Alternatively, you can also hit Enter on your keyboard once you're entered an address.</li>
